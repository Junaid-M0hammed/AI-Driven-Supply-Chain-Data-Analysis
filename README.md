# ðŸ“¦ AI-Driven Supply Chain Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how to automate and analyze supply chain data using modern AI tools like [n8n](https://n8n.io/) for workflow automation and [Quadratic](https://www.quadratichq.com/) for intelligent spreadsheet-based analytics. I created the full pipeline with real-world use cases.


## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

-  **n8n** â€“ for automated email monitoring and CSV extraction  
-  **PostgreSQL** â€“ as the primary data store  
-  **Quadratic** â€“ AI-powered spreadsheet for data analysis  
-  **CSV** â€“ input format for sales data  
- ðŸ“Š **KPIs** â€“ line fill rate, volume fill rate, on-time delivery  


##  Use Case: Atlique Mart (Organic Foods)

**Problem:** Inefficient order and inventory management  
**Solution:** Automated data ingestion + AI-driven analysis to track and improve fulfillment metrics



##  Data Flow & Architecture

1. Sales data received as email attachments (India & USA)
2. `n8n`:
   - Monitors Gmail inbox
   - Extracts CSVs
   - Converts them to JSON
   - Pushes to PostgreSQL
3. `Quadratic`:
   - Connects to Postgres
   - Uses prompts + functions to generate KPIs & charts


##  Key Learnings

- Automating daily ingestion & cleaning improves efficiency
- Using AI tools like Quadratic accelerates insight generation
- Date formatting & dimensional modeling are key to accuracy



##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Configure your n8n workflow using provided JSON
3. Set up PostgreSQL tables (`sales`, `order_lines`)
4. Connect Quadratic to your DB
5. Start analyzing!
